Dependency inversion principle

[x] What is DIP/how does it help?
"No high level class should be dependent on a lower level class." 
Both higher level and lower level class should depend on an abstract class or interface so that changes in one class 
(either high/low level) do not require changes in the other.

[x] Where else in the code do you notice the application of DIP?
The Logic class depends on the Command abstract class instead of directly on actual commands, 
so that if the implementation of a command e.g. AddCommand changes, Logic doesn't need to be changed
